Generates a Menu to access the under-mentioned problems.

## Problem_1_Is_Unique

The problem is to check whether a string has all unique characters.<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the string)

## Problem_2_Check_Permutation

The problem is to check whether one string is a permutation of another.<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the two strings when the lengths are equal, else O(1)))

## Problem_3_URLify

The problem is replace all spaces in the string with '%20'. (Given sufficient extra space at the end of the string)<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the string after replacement of spaces as above)

## Problem_4_Palindrome_Permutation

The problem is to check whether a string is a permutation of some palindrome.<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the string)

## Problem_5_One_Away

The problem is to check whether two string are one edit (or zero edit) away from each other.<br>
Edits are of the type: insert a character, remove a character or replace a character.<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the two strings when the lengths differ by atmost one, else O(1)))

## Problem_6_String_Compression

The problem is to perform basic string compression by replacing consecutive occurences of characters by the number of these occurences.<br>
If the new string is smaller in length, we return the new string else we return the original string itself.<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the string)

## Problem_7_Rotate_Matrix

The problem is to rotate a square matrix by 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
Runtime: O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N being the dimension of the square matrix)

## Problem_8_Zero_Matrix

The problem is to replace all row and columns element by 0 wherever we have a 0 in the original marix.<br>
Runtime: O(N X M) (N X M being the dimensions of the matrix)

## Problem_9_String_Rotation

The problem is to check whether one string is a rotation of another, given a function to check sub-string.<br>
Runtime: O(n) (n being the length of the two strings when the lengths are equal, else O(1)))
