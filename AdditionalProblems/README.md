## Additional_main

Generates a Menu to access the under-mentioned problems.

## CommonElements

The problem is to find Common Elements in two sorted arrays. (Given no duplicates)<br>
Runtime: O(a+b) (a and b being the length of these arrays)

## ExpandingArrayMedian

The problem is to keep track of the Median an Expanding array.<br>
A min and a max heap in used.<br>
Runtime: O(log n) (to find median)

## IterativePermutation

The problem is to display all permutations of a given string.<br>
Iterative approach is used.<br>
Runtime: O(n!)

## MatchPermutation

The problem is to match permutation of a smaller string in a bigger string.<br>
Runtime: O(s*b) (s and b being size of small and big string respectively)

## MathIdentity

The problem is to find all pairs that satisfy a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> = c<sup>3</sup> + d<sup>3</sup><br>
Given a,b,c,d are natural numbers less than equal to 1000.<br>
Runtime: O(1000<sup>2</sup>)

## RansomNote

The problem is to find whether a ransom note can be written out of words from a magazine.<br>
Runtime: O(n+m) (n and m being size of ransom note and magazine respectively)

## RecursivePermutation

The problem is to display all permutations of a given string.<br>
Recursive approach is used.<br>
Runtime: O(n!)

## SortStringList

The problem is to sort strings in a list, and then sort the whole list.<br>
Runtime: O(s*n(log s + log n)) (s being the length of longest string and n the number of strings)
